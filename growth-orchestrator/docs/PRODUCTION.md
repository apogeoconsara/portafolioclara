# Production thinking

What changes between this slice and something Clara could run.

## Reliability
- **Ingest**: accept the webhook, verify the HMAC signature (`ORCH_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, already in `serve`), write to a
  durable inbox, return 2xx; process from a queue (SQS / Pub/Sub) with per-account ordering (FIFO group = account_id)
  so one account's events never race each other. The three-way dedupe and the `processed` table stay as they are.
- **Exactly-once effects**: keep idempotency keys per business effect and the "look up before retry" rule; use the
  providers' native idempotency headers where they exist. Outbox pattern: decision + pending action in one transaction,
  a dispatcher performs the call.
- **Retries**: the policy in `send_policy.json` (backoff + jitter, Retry-After, never retry 4xx, budget then
  dead-letter + alert + human). Circuit breaker per provider so an outage does not burn every account's retry budget.
- **Scheduled sends**: a scheduler calls `run_due`; every send is re-decided at send time (already implemented).
- **Model API**: timeouts, one retry on 429/5xx, then the safe fallback (escalate / generic template) — never block
  the pipeline on the LLM.

## Security
- Secrets only in the platform's secret store (the Netlify function reads `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` server-side; nothing is
  committed). Separate keys per environment, rotation, least privilege on CRM scopes.
- Treat replies and enrichment as untrusted input: quoted lines stripped, injection detection, the model cannot trigger
  actions directly, output validated before use, HTML-escaped in any UI.
- PII: minimise what goes into prompts (no emails/phones unless needed), retention policy for replies and model I/O,
  provider DPA, regional data residency where required (LatAm data-protection laws: MX LFPDPPP, BR LGPD, CO, AR, CL, PE).
- Compliance: suppression is global and checked at decision AND send time; unsubscribe footer is mandatory; legal
  sign-off on templates and claims.

## Observability
- The audit log is the trace: one row per step with event, state version, decision, reasons, model output, verdict and
  action. Ship it to a warehouse.
- Metrics: events by handling, decisions by action/reason, AI verdicts and codes by label, confidence distribution,
  reviewer override rate, retries / dead letters per provider, review-queue age, sends vs cap.
- Alerts: any unsafe-action indicator, opt-out guard firing rate jump, dead-letter spike, provider error rate,
  review-queue SLA breach, guardrail metrics from the experiment.

## Scale
- 50k accounts/month is small: ~2k events/day. SQLite → Postgres (row-level locking on account versions), workers
  scale horizontally because ordering is per account.
- LLM cost: ~1 call per reply and ≤ 1 per personalized email; Haiku-class pricing keeps it in cents per thousand
  accounts. Cache by input hash for replays.
- Enrichment is the expensive dependency: batch, cache by domain, respect provider rate limits (already modeled).

## Build vs buy
| piece | choice | reason |
|---|---|---|
| eligibility rules, routing, guards, audit | **build** | this is Clara's policy and its competitive edge; must be testable and owned |
| CRM, sequencer/ESP, calendar | **buy** (HubSpot/Salesforce, an ESP with suppression + deliverability tooling, Google/Outlook calendars) | commodity, deliverability is a specialist problem |
| enrichment | **buy** (one primary + one fallback provider) | data coverage is the product; contradictions handled by our rules |
| LLM | **buy** the model, **build** the prompts, validators and evals | the safety layer and eval set are ours |
| queue, scheduler, warehouse | managed cloud services | no reason to run them ourselves |

## Before turning on real sending
Replace the assumption files (`send_policy.json`, `decision_policy.json`) with Clara's real rules; connect the real
suppression source of truth; run in shadow mode (decide, don't act) against live events for two weeks and compare with
what SDRs did; then start the experiment in the measurement plan with a small treatment share.
